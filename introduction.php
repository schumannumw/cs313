                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I come from a family of seven, two brothers and four sisters. I grew up in the cache valley area of northern Utah my dad originally was a farmer but is now currently working in cache valley driving the public transportation bus. After I graduated High School I worked at RR Donnelley helping in the mailing process for major companies around the states. Once I turned nineteen I went on a mission to Uruguay for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, there I was able to learn many communication and serving skills that continue to help me through my life. The best part of serving in Uruguay was not what I learned, but the people that we were able to help. I was truly blessed to have been born a member of the LDS Church and to follow the examples of my parents and family members. Although before my mission my mom was diagnosed with cancer we were all able to receive comfort from each other and the gospel in our lives. Now we can look back on the blessings that we have and continue to receive together, realizing that blessings come from our loving Heavenly Father.</p>
